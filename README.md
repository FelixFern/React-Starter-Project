# Felix's React Starter Project - Vite + React + Typescript with SWC

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite to build your app with ease, this template provides you with how I usually structure my React project directories and preconfigured Prettier to give you good DX when developing a frontend application. This project also includes [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to help you build your UI as quickly as possible.
